# Project 4 Prep

## Overview & Goals
I will create three separate interactive applications or visualizations, a navigation page that provides access to all of them, and a documentation page describing what I did and how I did it. My goal is to become more familiar with javascript and to hopefully create pieces of work that I can add to my portfolio.
