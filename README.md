# Project 4 Prep

## Overview & Goals
I will create three separate interactive applications or visualizations, a navigation page that provides access to all of them, and a documentation page describing what I did and how I did it. My goal is to become fore familiar with javascript and to hopefully create pieces of work that I can add to my portfolio.

## Content and Functional Requirements
What are you going to make? Storyboard it, and think about what kind of functionality you'll need in order to implement it. 

## Javascript
What type of interaction do you need to implement? Which library or libraries will you need in order ot make it work?

## Additional Notes
I would like for my grade for project 4 to replace my grade only for project 2. Thank you!
