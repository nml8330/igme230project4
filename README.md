# Project 4 Prep

## Overview & Goals
I will create three separate interactive applications or visualizations, a navigation page that provides access to all of them, and a documentation page describing what I did and how I did it. My goal is to become more familiar with javascript and to hopefully create pieces of work that I can add to my portfolio.

## Content and Functional Requirements
1. 13-Key Piano
>A 13-key piano that will produce a specific note upon clicking each specific key.
2. Color Gradient Test
>Test your color skills by clicking and draging blocks of colors ranging from red to purple into the correct order.
3. Personal Introduction Animated Graphic
>Graphic of the outline of a box drawn around my introduction of "Hi, I am" followed by the appearance of "Nicole Lopez" which then changes to "a designer" which then changes to "a developer." It's a little hard to exaplin, but I hope that the finished product will clarify things.

## Javascript
1. SVG
2. Canvas
3. SVG

## Additional Notes
I would like for my grade for project 4 to replace my grade only for project 2. Thank you!
