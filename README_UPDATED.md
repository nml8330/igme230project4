# Project 4 Prep

## Overview & Goals
I will create three separate interactive applications or visualizations, a navigation page that provides access to all of them, and a documentation page describing what I did and how I did it. My goal is to become more familiar with JavaScript and to hopefully create pieces of work that I can add to my portfolio.

Two will be like interactive games while the third, an animation. Although there is no specific theme that relates them, they are all interesting challenges to create and I would love to be able to show them off on my portfolio website.

## Content and Functional Requirements
1. 13-Key Piano
>A 13-key piano that will produce a specific note upon clicking each specific key.
2. Color Gradient Test
>Test your color skills by clicking and dragging blocks of colors ranging from dark red to light red in the correct order.
3. Personal Introduction Animated Graphic
>Graphic of the outline of a box drawn around my introduction of "Hi, I am" followed by the appearance of "Nicole Lopez" which then changes to "a designer" which then changes to "a developer." It's a little hard to explain, but I hope that the finished product will clarify things.

## Javascript
1. SVG
2. Canvas
3. SVG

## Additional Notes
I would like for my grade for project 4 to replace my grade only for project 2. Thank you!
