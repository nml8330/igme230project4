# Project 4 Prep

## Overview & Goals
I will create three separate versions of an interactive game, a navigation page that provides access to all of them, and a documentation page describing what I did and how I did it. My goal is to become more familiar with JavaScript and to hopefully create a piece of work that I can add to my portfolio.

I will be creating what I will call a "Color Gradient Test". This test will consist of dragging blocks of colors ranging from dark red to light red and organizing them into the correct order of light to dark.

## Content and Functional Requirements
1. Basic Layout
>The simplest version will consist of most content in the correct layout. There will be a working dragging functionality.
2. Finished Test
>The standard version will consist of the same functionality as the one before, but will also include a working submmit button, scoring, and score-displaying mechanic. The test will be completed through drop-down menus by which choosing a certain color will change the placeholder box that color.
3. Test Embelishment
>The advanced version will consist of the same funcionality as the one before, but will also (hopefully) use the dragging functionality to the fullest by allowing the user to drag each color block into place and scoring it depending on which color has been placed in the box. I am also hoping to add a timer function or to randomize the starting placement of each color block.

## Javascript
I will be using HTML Canvas for this project.

## Additional Notes
I would like for my grade for project 4 to replace my grade only for project 2. Thank you!
