                                <strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
                                <br>I programmed each page of the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery in the text-editor "Brackets". For the three interactive implementations, most of the pages consist of HTML Canvas.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>What I learned:</strong>
                                <br>Initially, I dreaded having to use JavaScript. As convinient as it is in adding flare to a website, it is also much more challenging to me than HTML and CSS. However, since coding everything throughout the night, I have begun to enjoy it. There are so many cool things that you can accomplish using JavaScript and JQuery that you wouldn't be able to with only HTML and CSS. Although I'm still having a good amount of trouble, I feel like I'm learning little by little. I realize that my method of programming (at least for this project) is very slow, repetitive, and meticulous. I hope that I can come back to this in the future and write more efficient code as well as add new features/functions that I don't currently have.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>Above and beyond:</strong>
                                <br>Considering what I've done in the past, I think I may have gone way out of my league with my original plan that also didn't quite follow all of the guidelines for this project. So, I set out with a new goal in mind and, with the power of the internet, I think I managed to get most of what I set out to do. I decided on a quirky design for the home and documentation pages that would still look nice on a smaller window size. Although I can't say the same for my Color Gradient Test pages, I worked really hard on perfecting each part, no matter the time constraint. This might have been good for effort or bad for the purpose of uploading it on time, but I would love for my first original work using JavaScript to be good enough to be part of my portfolio.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>Online resources:</strong>
                                <br>Of course, the online resources I used most frequently consisted of W3Schools, Stack Overflow, and random "How to Code Websites" sites on the internet. However, the main resource I used consistently was https://konvajs.github.io/docs/. KonvaJS is a Canvas/JavaScript library specifically made for creating objects with Canvas, which was exactly what I needed. The website provided me with solutions to most of the problems I had, so I added a script connecting me to the Konva JS file. I will most likely reference it in the future and really recommend using it to students new to Canvas.

                            <br><strong>Inspiration:</strong>
                                <br>The inspiration for the Color Gradient Test/Game came from a show I watched on Netflix called "Brain Games". One of the brain games was a test asking how many different shades of red there were in a line. So, I thought it might be fun to create my own online test where the user would place the blockes of color in order of lightest to darkest.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>Short-Comings:</strong>
                                <br>I did not schedule my work time well, so I ended up doing this very late, as you know. I wish I could have written more efficient code than simply copy-pasting everything while changing just one character. It would also have been nice to be able to perfect everything more, but I did my best with what I knew and the time that I had.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>Final Notes:</strong>
                                <br>Again, thank you so much for granting me this extension! And thank you for a great semester- I really enjoyed learning more about Website Design and Development! Happy Holidays and have a wonderful break :)
